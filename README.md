Hello my name is Terran.
I am just starting my journey to become an application developer.
I am trying to built a network of like minded application dev professionals who want to grow to become the best that they can be.
I am open to all sorts of ideas and paths of learning, I haven't focused on one technology yet but just testing the waters on many to see what all is out there.
I am honing my skills in Java/C#, MySQL and Unity game Dev.
I would love to get help out with some opensource code so please let me know what you have or if you think there is a project where I could help.
